## Immer is awesome

https://github.com/immerjs/immer#benefits

- It is tiny: 4.4kb (minfied + gzipped)

  - less than 2x the size of react (core)
  - about 1/8th the size of react-dom
  - slighly smaller than react-redux (5.5kb (minfied + gzipped))

- It is just one wrapper (there are other functions, but I haven't needed them)

- You can write regular JS (no new API to learn)

- It allows you to write mutable code as pure functions ðŸ¤¯

- It's plenty fast for 90% of use cases
  (https://github.com/immerjs/immer#performance)

  - and sometimes it will give you other performance boosts

- Auto freezing out of the box (https://github.com/immerjs/immer#auto-freezing)

- It makes life easier for all developers, from junior devs, to seasoned
  spreading ninjas
