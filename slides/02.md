# How to manage your state

# Three principles for code state management

These principles are for anyone and everyone who wants reasonable,
straightforward state management in their frontend applications.

- Single source of truth
- State is read-only
- Changes are made with pure functions

longer

If you've never read the docs, you should check out the following:

- https://redux.js.org/introduction/motivation
- https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts
- https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles

So how do we incorporate these principles?
