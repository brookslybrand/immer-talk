# Some background

## How to manage your state

Using react-redux convinced me that mutating state is bad.

Why? If you've never read the docs, you should check out the following:

- https://redux.js.org/introduction/motivation
- https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts
- https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles

Specifically, in the "three principles" doc, they say:

> "Redux can be described in three fundamental principles:"

- Single source of truth
- State is read-only
- Changes are made with pure functions

## These principles aren't redux-specific

They're for anyone and everyone who wants reasonable, straightforward state
management in their frontend applications.

So how do we get there?
